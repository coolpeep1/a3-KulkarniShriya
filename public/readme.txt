Kulkarni, Shriya
This project records T.V shows a user has watched
 and evaluates progress, remaining episodes, and the percentage completed.
I used a flexbox and navigation bar to appropriately align the

Technical Achievements
Tech Achievement 1: This app evaluates data in real-time about T.V shows
a user has watched and returns new calculations in a table.
